英文版：[The Open Organization Guide for Educators](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/educators-guide)

What if we could build classrooms, departments, or entire educational institutions on the same values that power open source communities? What if we let open organization principles—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—guide our experiments in transforming education? How might that change the ways educators prepare students for life in an increasingly open world? In The Open Organization Guide for Educators, more than two dozen advocates for open education explore these important questions.

[Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Open-Innovation-Imperative-Profiting-Technology/dp/1578518377)， Henry William Chesbrough ，Harvard Business Review Press; First Trade Paper edition (1 April 2003)

In today's information-rich environment, companies can no longer afford to rely entirely on their own ideas to advance their business, nor can they restrict their innovations to a single path to market. As a result, says Harvard Business School professor Henry W. Chesbrough, the traditional model for innovation - which has been largely internally focused, closed off from outside ideas and technologies - is becoming obsolete. Emerging in its place is a new paradigm, 'open innovation', which strategically leverages internal and external sources of ideas and takes them to market through multiple paths. This path-breaking analysis is based on extensive field research, academic study, and the author's own longtime experience working in Silicon Valley.Through rich descriptions of the innovation processes of Xerox, IBM, Lucent, Intel, Merck, and Millennium, and the many spin-offs that have emerged from these firms, "Open Innovation" shows how companies can use their business model to identify a more enlightened role for R&D in a world of abundant information, better manage and access intellectual property, advance their current business, and grow their future business.

Arguing that companies in all industries must transform the way they commercialize knowledge, Chesbrough convincingly shows how open innovation can unlock the latent economic value in a company's ideas and technologies. Author Bio: Henry W. Chesbrough is an Assistant Professor and the Class of 1961 Fellow at Harvard Business School.

### Open Innovation Results: Going Beyond the Hype and Getting Down to Business

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UkxcVeXmL.jpg)

内容介绍：

We live in an age of exponential technology, but this is not so new. Indeed, technological innovation has been promoted so assiduously for so long that there is now a discernible pattern to its emergence known as the Gartner Hype Cycle. Open innovation is no exception. In this book Henry Chesbrough, the originator of open innovation, examines the hype behind its practice, shows where real results are taking place, and explains how companies can move beyond the hype
to achieve real business results.

The book begins with an exponential paradox; new technologies are emerging at an accelerating rate, yet we continue to see stagnant wages and lagging production. These realities are hard to reconcile with the promise of exponential technologies. A closer look suggests that exponential advocates are paying too little attention to the broad dissemination and absorption of a new technology before it delivers real profit and social benefit.

To get valuable results from innovation, businesses must open up their innovation processes and finish more of what they start. They need to open their knowledge flows to generate new growth, and unused internal knowledge must flow openly to others to generate new revenue and future business opportunities. Many of the best known aspects of open innovation such as crowdsourcing, open source software, or innovation intermediaries are often not well connected to the rest of the organization. Using
numerous real-world examples of these methods in practice, Chesbrough illustrates how they can, and must, be used in connection to the organization as a whole in order to have real long-term value.

Open Innovation Results offers a clear-eyed view of the challenges and realities that limit the ability of organizations to create and profit from innovation. Whether in the largest companies or in a small business, an advanced economy or a rural village, this book charts a course to enhance organizational growth and performance.

[Free Innovation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/free-innovation),Eric von Hippel,November 2016， MIT Press

A leading innovation scholar explains the growing phenomenon and impact of free innovation, in which innovations developed by consumers and given away “for free.”

In this book, Eric von Hippel, author of the influential Democratizing Innovation, integrates new theory and research findings into the framework of a “free innovation paradigm.” Free innovation, as he defines it, involves innovations developed by consumers who are self-rewarded for their efforts, and who give their designs away “for free.” It is an inherently simple grassroots innovation process, unencumbered by compensated transactions and intellectual property rights.

Free innovation is already widespread in national economies and is steadily increasing in both scale and scope. Today, tens of millions of consumers are collectively spending tens of billions of dollars annually on innovation development. However, because free innovations are developed during consumers' unpaid, discretionary time and are given away rather than sold, their collective impact and value have until very recently been hidden from view. This has caused researchers, governments, and firms to focus too much on the Schumpeterian idea of innovation as a producer-dominated activity.

Free innovation has both advantages and drawbacks. Because free innovators are self-rewarded by such factors as personal utility, learning, and fun, they often pioneer new areas before producers see commercial potential. At the same time, because they give away their innovations, free innovators generally have very little incentive to invest in diffusing what they create, which reduces the social value of their efforts.

The best solution, von Hippel and his colleagues argue, is a division of labor between free innovators and producers, enabling each to do what they do best. The result will be both increased producer profits and increased social welfare—a gain for all.

### The Hacker Ethic: A Radical Approach to the Philosophy of Business (English Edition)

![](https://images-cn.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LHBOgeCOL.jpg)



#### 内容提要：

You may be a hacker and not even know it. Being a hacker has nothing to do with cyberterrorism, and it doesn’t even necessarily relate to the open-source movement. Being a hacker has more to do with your underlying assumptions about stress, time management, work, and play. It’s about harmonizing the rhythms of your creative work with the rhythms of the rest of your life so that they amplify each other. It is a fundamentally new work ethic that is revolutionizing the way business is being done around the world.

Without hackers there would be no universal access to e-mail, no Internet, no World Wide Web, but the hacker ethic has spread far beyond the world of computers. It is a mind-set, a philosophy, based on the values of play, passion, sharing, and creativity, that has the potential to enhance every individual’s and company’s productivity and competitiveness. Now there is a greater need than ever for entrepreneurial versatility of the sort that has made hackers the most important innovators of our day. Pekka Himanen shows how we all can make use of this ongoing transformation in the way we approach our working lives.

## 2020 主题三：开源的经济、社会、政治学解释

### 

![](https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s3077608.jpg)

中文版：[《开源的成功之路》](https://book.douban.com/subject/2153786/)， 史蒂文 ，外研社·哈佛科学人文译丛，2007.6

英文版: [The Success of Open Source](https://book.douban.com/subject/1899468/),Steven Weber ,Harvard University Press ,2004

《开源的成功之路》的编者提出的论点是，开源社区首创精神的意义尤为深远。通过探讨构成财产的基本概念，该社区重新改写了一些最基本的管理问题。与此同时，它正在重建软件世界的政治学和经济学。假如您就像编者一样深信，在未来，软件构成的一些核心工具和原则将指导人类如何协同工作，协助人们创造财富并开创美好的未来，寻求新思想和新问题的解决方案，那么，理解开源如何改变这些过程至关重要。作为一名政治学家，编者更关心社区的管理方式，而非技术本身。编者之所以对开源产生兴趣，正是因为这个新兴的技术社区似乎能够以一种非常新奇而动人的方式，解决在编者看来相当棘手但常见的基本管理问题。

英文版： [Internet Success: A Study of Open-Source Software Commons](https://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262017251.001.0001/upso-9780262017251)，Charles M. Schweik and Robert C. English， Published to MIT Press Scholarship Online，2012

The use of open-source software (OSS)—readable software source code that can be copied, modified, and distributed freely—has expanded dramatically in recent years. The number of OSS projects hosted on SourceForge.net (the largest hosting Web site for OSS), for example, grew from just over 100,000 in 2006 to more than 250,000 at the beginning of 2011. But why are some projects successful—that is, able to produce usable software and sustain ongoing development over time—while others are abandoned? This book, the product of a large-scale empirical study to look at social, technical, and institutional aspects of OSS, examines factors that lead to success in OSS projects and work toward a better understanding of Internet-based collaboration. Drawing on literature from many disciplines and using a theoretical framework developed for the study of environmental commons, it examines stages of OSS development, presenting multivariate statistical models of success and abandonment. The authors argue that analyzing the conditions of OSS successes may also inform Internet collaborations in fields beyond software engineering, particularly those which aim to solve complex technical, social, and political problems.

>
> In this urgent and provocative book, Rufus Pollock shows how today’s "Closed" digital economy is the source of problems ranging from growing inequality, to unaffordable medicines, to the power of a handful of tech monopolies to control how we think and vote. He proposes a solution that charts a path to a more equitable, innovative and profitable future for all.

作者：[[美\] 曼瑟尔·奥尔森](https://book.douban.com/author/265466/)

内容介绍：

全书共分6章。第1章对集团和组织行为的某些方面作了逻辑的理论的解释。第2章考察了对不同规模的集团进行分析的含义，并得出在许多情况下小集团更有效率、更富有生命力这一结论。第3章考察了赞成工会的论点的含义，并得出以下结论：某一形式的强制性会员制度在大多数情况下对工会是生死攸关的。第4章运用本研究中提出的方法对马克思的社会阶级理论进行考察并对其他一些经济学家提出的国家理论进行分析。第5章按照本研究阐述的逻辑对许多政治学家使用的“集团理论”进行分析，并证明对这一理论的通常理解在逻辑上是矛盾的。最后一章提出了一个与第1章概述的逻辑关系相一致的新的压力集团理论。这一理论说明大的压力集团组织的会员制度和力量并不是游说疏通活动的结果，而是它们其他活动的副产品。

### Cultivating Communities of Practice: A Guide to Managing Knowledge

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51AJ4PNaxpL._SY346_.jpg)

#### 作者简介：

Etienne Wenger-Trayner (formerly Wenger) is a globally recognized thought leader in the field of social learning theory, communities of practice, and their application to organizations. He has authored and co-authored seminal articles and books on the topic, including Situated Learning, where the term "community of practice" was coined; Communities of Practice: learning, meaning, and identity, where he lays out a theory of learning based on the concept; Cultivating Communities of Practice, addressed to practitioners in organizations who want to base their knowledge strategy on communities of practice; and Digital Habitats, which tackles issues of technology. Etienne's work is influencing both theory and practice in a range of disciplines, as well as a growing number of organizations in the private and public sectors. He helps organizations apply his ideas through consulting, public speaking, and workshops. He is also active in the academic sphere. He regularly speaks at conferences, conducts seminars, and is a visiting professor at the universities of Manchester and Aalborg. He recently received an honorary doctorate from the university of Brighton.

#### 内容简介：

Today's economy is fueled by knowledge. Every leader knows this to be true, yet few have systematic methods for converting organizational knowledge into economic value. This book argues that communities of practice--groups of individuals formed around common interests and expertise--provide the ideal vehicle for driving knowledge-management strategies and building lasting competitive advantage. Written by leading experts in the field, Cultivating Communities of Practice is the first book to outline models and methods for systematically developing these essential groups. Through compelling research and company examples, including DaimlerChrysler, McKinsey & Company, Shell, and the World Bank, authors Etienne Wenger, Richard McDermott, and William M. Snyder show how world-class organizations have leveraged communities of practice to drive strategy, generate new business opportunities, solve problems, transfer best practices, develop employees' professional skills, and recruit and retain top talent. Underscoring the new central role communities of practice are playing in today's knowledge economy, Cultivating Communities of Practice is the definitive guide to fostering, designing, and developing these powerful groups within and across organizations.

* Star Citizen used Kickstarter to raise over $150 million to build their new video game and a community of over 2 million players.
* Red Hat collaborated with their community to build industry-leading technology, which led to a $34 billion acquisition by IBM
* Companies such as PayPal, Facebook, Bosch, Microsoft, CapitalOne, and Google, have also built communities inside their organizations, which have fostered innovation, broken down silos, and helped their organizations to operate more efficiently and collaboratively.

> People Powered helps C-suite leaders, founders, marketers, customer advocates, and community leaders gain a competitive advantage by answering the following questions:

* What is the key value proposition of building a community?

## Communities Dominate Brands 

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515fMzN4qaL._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)



>  Communities Dominate Brands: Business and marketing challenges for the 21st century is a book about how the new phenomenon of digitally connected communities are emerging as a force to counterbalance the power of the big brands and advertising. The book explores the problems faced by branding, marketing and advertising facing multiple radical changes in this decade. Communities Dominate Brands discusses how disruptive effects of digitalisation and connectedness introduce threats and opportunities. The authors compellingly illustrate how modern consumers are forming communities and peer-groups to pool their power resulting in a dramatic revolution of how businesses interact with their customers. The book provides practical guidance of how to move from obsolete interruptive advertising to interactive engagement marketing and community based communications, with dozens of real business examples from around the world. Communities Dominate Brands addresses its topic from a marketing (including advertising and branding) perspective and maintains a rigorous focus on business and profit dimensions of the issues involved. The book discusses such recent phenomena as blogging, virtual environments, mobile phone based swarming and massively multiplayer games. The book introduces a new generation of consumers called Generation-C (for Community). The book also discusses such new concepts as the Connected Age, Reachability, the Four C's, Alpha Users, and introduces Communities as an unavoidable new element into the traditional communication model. Combining the digital trends, modern management theories, and emerging new customer behaviour, Communities Dominate Brands arrives to its conclusion, that traditional marketing methods are increasingly ineffective and even becoming counterproductive. The power of the brands and the abuses by marketing have created a vacuum for a counterbalance, and digitally connected communities, the blogosphere, gamers, and especially the always-on connectedness of those on mobile phone networks, are emerging as the counterforce to redress the balance. The power of smart mobs and digitally enlightened communities will react rapidly to marketing excesses as the natural force balancing the power of the brands. The way a business can and must interact with the powerful new communities is through engagement marketing, by enticing the communities to interact with the brands. Communities Dominate Brands covers the major changes taking place in business and industry worldwide from leading digitally connected societies such as Finland, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, UK and the USA. The authors discuss the business relevance of such community related technologies and phenomena such as blogging, CANs, iPod, MMOGs, MVNOs, PVRs, Ringing Tones, SMS text messaging, swarming, VOD. This is the definitive business book on the impact of new technologies, not explaining how technology works, but showing what businesses need to do to make money in the new digitally converging environment. Communities Dominate Brands analyses early successes of engaging communities by global brands such as Adidas, Apple, Audi, BBC, Boeing, Coca Cola, eBay, Ford, Google, Guinness, Hush Puppies, Lonely Planet, MTV, Nokia, Orange, Philips, Red Bull, Sony, Tesco, Tony & Guy, Vodafone, etc. The lessons are amplified with insights from rough punishment by communities suffered by Hutchison/Three networks, Kryptonite locks, Mazda, the Philippines Government, etc. Fully indexed, impeccably researched with documented sources, offering over 50 current business examples and over a dozen case studies, Communities Dominate Brands is a hands-on practical business handbook on how to adjust marketing to deal with communities. With tools such as the Four C's and Reachability, the authors provide a competitive head-start to all who want to achieve customer satisfaction and return business in the 21st century.

### 工程学：无尽的前沿

#### 内容提要

我们生活在一个工程的世界里，科学和工程、技术和研究之间的根本差别正在快速消泯之中。本书展示的是：随着21世纪的曙光降临，自然科学家的目标——发现什么是未知的，工程师的目标——创造什么是未有的，两者正在经历一种前所未有的一体化趋同过程。

欧阳莹之广泛地论证了：当今的工程学不仅是科学的合作者，而且两者同等重要。通过简略地提及工业实验室、化学工程和电气工程的出现，机床工业和汽车工业旋风般的历史进程，以及核能技术和信息技术的兴起，她的著作展现了现代工程学的壮阔图景：它的历史、结构、技术成就和社会责任性，它同自然科学、工商管理和公共政策的相互关系。欧阳莹之擅长利用案例进行研究，例如F117A型“夜鹰”隐形战斗机、波音777型客机的开发，以及亥维赛等工程师兼科学家型、福特和比尔·盖茨等工程师兼企业家型、斯隆和韦尔奇等工程师兼经理型等杰出人物的实践，给广大读者一种清晰的感悟：工程学必将在未来科学研究中发挥基本作用。

#### 作者简介

欧阳莹之（Sunny Y. Auyang），美籍华裔物理学家、科学学家，先后在上海、香港、美国等地就读小学、中学、大学,1972年获麻省理工学院物理学博士学位。毕业后曾在美国惠普公司供职，后在麻省理工学院从事研究工作20余年,1992年以来,她的研究兴趣转向对科学技术本质的哲学考察。除了本书外，还著有《量子场论如何可能?》（1995）、《复杂系统理论基础》（1998）、《日常生活和认知科学中的心智》（2000）等。
