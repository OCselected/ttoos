英文版：[The Open Organization Guide for Educators](https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/educators-guide)

What if we could build classrooms, departments, or entire educational institutions on the same values that power open source communities? What if we let open organization principles—like transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration, and community—guide our experiments in transforming education? How might that change the ways educators prepare students for life in an increasingly open world? In The Open Organization Guide for Educators, more than two dozen advocates for open education explore these important questions.

[Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Open-Innovation-Imperative-Profiting-Technology/dp/1578518377)， Henry William Chesbrough ，Harvard Business Review Press; First Trade Paper edition (1 April 2003)

In today's information-rich environment, companies can no longer afford to rely entirely on their own ideas to advance their business, nor can they restrict their innovations to a single path to market. As a result, says Harvard Business School professor Henry W. Chesbrough, the traditional model for innovation - which has been largely internally focused, closed off from outside ideas and technologies - is becoming obsolete. Emerging in its place is a new paradigm, 'open innovation', which strategically leverages internal and external sources of ideas and takes them to market through multiple paths. This path-breaking analysis is based on extensive field research, academic study, and the author's own longtime experience working in Silicon Valley.Through rich descriptions of the innovation processes of Xerox, IBM, Lucent, Intel, Merck, and Millennium, and the many spin-offs that have emerged from these firms, "Open Innovation" shows how companies can use their business model to identify a more enlightened role for R&D in a world of abundant information, better manage and access intellectual property, advance their current business, and grow their future business.

Arguing that companies in all industries must transform the way they commercialize knowledge, Chesbrough convincingly shows how open innovation can unlock the latent economic value in a company's ideas and technologies. Author Bio: Henry W. Chesbrough is an Assistant Professor and the Class of 1961 Fellow at Harvard Business School.

[Free Innovation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/free-innovation),Eric von Hippel,November 2016， MIT Press

A leading innovation scholar explains the growing phenomenon and impact of free innovation, in which innovations developed by consumers and given away “for free.”

In this book, Eric von Hippel, author of the influential Democratizing Innovation, integrates new theory and research findings into the framework of a “free innovation paradigm.” Free innovation, as he defines it, involves innovations developed by consumers who are self-rewarded for their efforts, and who give their designs away “for free.” It is an inherently simple grassroots innovation process, unencumbered by compensated transactions and intellectual property rights.

Free innovation is already widespread in national economies and is steadily increasing in both scale and scope. Today, tens of millions of consumers are collectively spending tens of billions of dollars annually on innovation development. However, because free innovations are developed during consumers' unpaid, discretionary time and are given away rather than sold, their collective impact and value have until very recently been hidden from view. This has caused researchers, governments, and firms to focus too much on the Schumpeterian idea of innovation as a producer-dominated activity.

Free innovation has both advantages and drawbacks. Because free innovators are self-rewarded by such factors as personal utility, learning, and fun, they often pioneer new areas before producers see commercial potential. At the same time, because they give away their innovations, free innovators generally have very little incentive to invest in diffusing what they create, which reduces the social value of their efforts.

The best solution, von Hippel and his colleagues argue, is a division of labor between free innovators and producers, enabling each to do what they do best. The result will be both increased producer profits and increased social welfare—a gain for all.

### The Hacker Ethic: A Radical Approach to the Philosophy of Business (English Edition)

![](https://images-cn.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LHBOgeCOL.jpg)



#### 内容提要：

You may be a hacker and not even know it. Being a hacker has nothing to do with cyberterrorism, and it doesn’t even necessarily relate to the open-source movement. Being a hacker has more to do with your underlying assumptions about stress, time management, work, and play. It’s about harmonizing the rhythms of your creative work with the rhythms of the rest of your life so that they amplify each other. It is a fundamentally new work ethic that is revolutionizing the way business is being done around the world.

Without hackers there would be no universal access to e-mail, no Internet, no World Wide Web, but the hacker ethic has spread far beyond the world of computers. It is a mind-set, a philosophy, based on the values of play, passion, sharing, and creativity, that has the potential to enhance every individual’s and company’s productivity and competitiveness. Now there is a greater need than ever for entrepreneurial versatility of the sort that has made hackers the most important innovators of our day. Pekka Himanen shows how we all can make use of this ongoing transformation in the way we approach our working lives.

## 2020 主题三：开源的经济、社会、政治学解释

### 

![](https://img1.doubanio.com/view/subject/l/public/s3077608.jpg)

中文版：[《开源的成功之路》](https://book.douban.com/subject/2153786/)， 史蒂文 ，外研社·哈佛科学人文译丛，2007.6

英文版: [The Success of Open Source](https://book.douban.com/subject/1899468/),Steven Weber ,Harvard University Press ,2004

《开源的成功之路》的编者提出的论点是，开源社区首创精神的意义尤为深远。通过探讨构成财产的基本概念，该社区重新改写了一些最基本的管理问题。与此同时，它正在重建软件世界的政治学和经济学。假如您就像编者一样深信，在未来，软件构成的一些核心工具和原则将指导人类如何协同工作，协助人们创造财富并开创美好的未来，寻求新思想和新问题的解决方案，那么，理解开源如何改变这些过程至关重要。作为一名政治学家，编者更关心社区的管理方式，而非技术本身。编者之所以对开源产生兴趣，正是因为这个新兴的技术社区似乎能够以一种非常新奇而动人的方式，解决在编者看来相当棘手但常见的基本管理问题。

英文版： [Internet Success: A Study of Open-Source Software Commons](https://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262017251.001.0001/upso-9780262017251)，Charles M. Schweik and Robert C. English， Published to MIT Press Scholarship Online，2012

The use of open-source software (OSS)—readable software source code that can be copied, modified, and distributed freely—has expanded dramatically in recent years. The number of OSS projects hosted on SourceForge.net (the largest hosting Web site for OSS), for example, grew from just over 100,000 in 2006 to more than 250,000 at the beginning of 2011. But why are some projects successful—that is, able to produce usable software and sustain ongoing development over time—while others are abandoned? This book, the product of a large-scale empirical study to look at social, technical, and institutional aspects of OSS, examines factors that lead to success in OSS projects and work toward a better understanding of Internet-based collaboration. Drawing on literature from many disciplines and using a theoretical framework developed for the study of environmental commons, it examines stages of OSS development, presenting multivariate statistical models of success and abandonment. The authors argue that analyzing the conditions of OSS successes may also inform Internet collaborations in fields beyond software engineering, particularly those which aim to solve complex technical, social, and political problems.

### People Powered: How Communities Can Supercharge Your Business, Brand, and Teams

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41zketWBS1L._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

> What if you discovered a blueprint that could grow your brand’s reputation and loyalty, dramatically reduce customer service issues, produce content and technology, and cement a powerful, lasting relationship between you and your customers?

> Communities have been a popular topic since the rise of the Internet and social media, but few companies have consistently harnessed their power, driven tangible value, and effectively measured their return on investment (ROI) like:

* Salesforce.com has seen tremendous results with their community network of over 2 million members advocating for, supporting, and integrating Salesforce.com products
* Star Citizen used Kickstarter to raise over $150 million to build their new video game and a community of over 2 million players.
* Red Hat collaborated with their community to build industry-leading technology, which led to a $34 billion acquisition by IBM
* Companies such as PayPal, Facebook, Bosch, Microsoft, CapitalOne, and Google, have also built communities inside their organizations, which have fostered innovation, broken down silos, and helped their organizations to operate more efficiently and collaboratively.

> People Powered helps C-suite leaders, founders, marketers, customer advocates, and community leaders gain a competitive advantage by answering the following questions:

* What is the key value proposition of building a community?
* What kind of community do we need and how do we build and integrate it into our organization?
* How do we incentivize and encourage people to get involved, build reliable growth, and keep community members engaged?
* How do we develop authentic, productive relationships with community members both online and in person?
* How do we get departmental buy-in, hire effectively, and create consistent, reliable community engagement skills in our organization?
* What are the strategic and tactical pitfalls and roadblocks we need to avoid?
* How do we make sure that our community continues to grow with us—and more importantly, how do we make sure that we continue to grow with them?

> People Powered pulls together over 20 years of pragmatic experience into a clear, simple methodology and blueprint to not just answer these questions, but deliver results. It also includes contributions from industry leaders including Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Emmy-award winning actor), Peter H. Diamandis (Founder of XPRIZE, Singularity University), Jim Zemlin (Executive Director, The Linux Foundation), Mike Shinoda (Co-Founder, Linkin Park), Jim Whitehurst (CEO, Red Hat), and more.

> Don’t get left behind—become an industry trailblazer and ensure your company’s longevity by tapping into the most dynamic force both outside and inside your organization: the people.

## Communities Dominate Brands 

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515fMzN4qaL._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)



>  Communities Dominate Brands: Business and marketing challenges for the 21st century is a book about how the new phenomenon of digitally connected communities are emerging as a force to counterbalance the power of the big brands and advertising. The book explores the problems faced by branding, marketing and advertising facing multiple radical changes in this decade. Communities Dominate Brands discusses how disruptive effects of digitalisation and connectedness introduce threats and opportunities. The authors compellingly illustrate how modern consumers are forming communities and peer-groups to pool their power resulting in a dramatic revolution of how businesses interact with their customers. The book provides practical guidance of how to move from obsolete interruptive advertising to interactive engagement marketing and community based communications, with dozens of real business examples from around the world. Communities Dominate Brands addresses its topic from a marketing (including advertising and branding) perspective and maintains a rigorous focus on business and profit dimensions of the issues involved. The book discusses such recent phenomena as blogging, virtual environments, mobile phone based swarming and massively multiplayer games. The book introduces a new generation of consumers called Generation-C (for Community). The book also discusses such new concepts as the Connected Age, Reachability, the Four C's, Alpha Users, and introduces Communities as an unavoidable new element into the traditional communication model. Combining the digital trends, modern management theories, and emerging new customer behaviour, Communities Dominate Brands arrives to its conclusion, that traditional marketing methods are increasingly ineffective and even becoming counterproductive. The power of the brands and the abuses by marketing have created a vacuum for a counterbalance, and digitally connected communities, the blogosphere, gamers, and especially the always-on connectedness of those on mobile phone networks, are emerging as the counterforce to redress the balance. The power of smart mobs and digitally enlightened communities will react rapidly to marketing excesses as the natural force balancing the power of the brands. The way a business can and must interact with the powerful new communities is through engagement marketing, by enticing the communities to interact with the brands. Communities Dominate Brands covers the major changes taking place in business and industry worldwide from leading digitally connected societies such as Finland, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, UK and the USA. The authors discuss the business relevance of such community related technologies and phenomena such as blogging, CANs, iPod, MMOGs, MVNOs, PVRs, Ringing Tones, SMS text messaging, swarming, VOD. This is the definitive business book on the impact of new technologies, not explaining how technology works, but showing what businesses need to do to make money in the new digitally converging environment. Communities Dominate Brands analyses early successes of engaging communities by global brands such as Adidas, Apple, Audi, BBC, Boeing, Coca Cola, eBay, Ford, Google, Guinness, Hush Puppies, Lonely Planet, MTV, Nokia, Orange, Philips, Red Bull, Sony, Tesco, Tony & Guy, Vodafone, etc. The lessons are amplified with insights from rough punishment by communities suffered by Hutchison/Three networks, Kryptonite locks, Mazda, the Philippines Government, etc. Fully indexed, impeccably researched with documented sources, offering over 50 current business examples and over a dozen case studies, Communities Dominate Brands is a hands-on practical business handbook on how to adjust marketing to deal with communities. With tools such as the Four C's and Reachability, the authors provide a competitive head-start to all who want to achieve customer satisfaction and return business in the 21st century.
